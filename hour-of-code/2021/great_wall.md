# The Great Wall of China

## Step 1
The Pandas keep eating the bamboo scaffolding, stopping the Engineer from completing the wall. Lead the pandas away from the wall. Code your Agent to PLACE 5 `Bamboo` pieces we've given the Agent.

#### ~ tutorialhint 
Use the ``||agent.agent move||`` block to position your Agent and ``||agent.agent place||`` to PLACE the `Bamboo` we've given the Agent.

```ghost
    agent.place(FORWARD)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 0)
    for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) {
    	
    }
```
```template
\\
```
```package
```
